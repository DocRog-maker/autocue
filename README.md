# Creating an autocue tool using Apryse Webviewer

This code is intended to be used with the blog https://apryse.com/blog/webviewer-in-autocue.

The code demonstrates how you can use WebViewer to automatically scroll, allowing you to use it as an autocue - ideal if you are narrating videos using a script that is a PDf or DOCX file.

# Getting started

Clone the repo using git clone

Install dependencies

Copy the contents of WebViewer ui and core folders into public/lib/webviewer

Run the project using npm run dev.
